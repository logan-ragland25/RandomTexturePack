hit run for a random texture pack
to start write in terminal:

note: 
    You may need a new block folder for every iteration
    It may break but most objects are randomized
    Only blocks are changed
    You will have to change file paths
    It is reccommended you delete the pot decorations and banner folders under the entity folder
