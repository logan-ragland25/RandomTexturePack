hit run for a random texture pack
to start write in terminal: 
    dotnet --version
    dotnet new console
    dotnet run

note: 
    You will need a texture folder, icon, and mcmeta (description) in a zipped folder, then drag it into th eminecraft texture packs folder
    The blank pack and icon are found in the minecraft files, the mcmeta will need to be downloaded from the web
    EVERYTHING is randomized unless you comment it out
    You will have to change file paths for it to work
    It is recommended you delete the pot decorations and banner folders under the entity folder, or else it may break and make a lot of boring textures
